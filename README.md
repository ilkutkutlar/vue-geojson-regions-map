# Vue.js GeoJSON Regions Map

Vue.js GeoJSON Regions Map is a simple plugin providing a `RegionsMap` component. This component uses OpenLayers to display a given GeoJSON file where you can pan, zoom, and interact with the features in your GeoJSON file. Additionally, you can pass a colour map to allow setting the fill colour of each feature. This is useful for apps where you want to set the fill colour of each region in a map to visualise regional data.
